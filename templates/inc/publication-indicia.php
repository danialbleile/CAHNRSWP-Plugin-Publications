      <p>Use pesticides with care. Apply them only to plants, animals, or sites as listed on the label. When mixing and applying pesticides, follow all label precautions to protect yourself and others around you. It is a violation of the law to disregard label directions. If pesticides are spilled on skin
        
        or clothing, remove clothing and wash skin thoroughly. Store pesticides in their original containers and keep them out of the reach of children, 
        
        pets, and livestock.</p>
